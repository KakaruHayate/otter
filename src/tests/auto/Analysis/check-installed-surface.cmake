# Installs the build into a scratch prefix and asserts the shape of what lands there.
#
# The installed tree is what a host builds against, so its contents are part of the interface. Part of
# that promise is a promise of absence: the readers under include/otter/Support are compiled into a
# private static library, and a header becomes public by accident as soon as it is installed. The
# expectations name the paths that have to be there rather than every file, so a new public header
# does not fail the check while a private one does.
#
# The check also holds the promise that one version serves the library, the packages and the release
# to the artifact a host actually reads: the CMake package version file advertises the version the
# project declares.
#
# Usage:
#     cmake -DOTTER_BUILD_DIR=<build> -DOTTER_TEST_PREFIX=<scratch> -DOTTER_VERSION=<version>
#           -DOTTER_EXPECT_PLUGINS=<ON|OFF> -P check-installed-surface.cmake
